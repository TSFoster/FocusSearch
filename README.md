#Â ![Focus Search icon](./lib/Icon-32.png) Focus Search

## A Safari extension to focus on your search results

Heavily relying on keyboard shortcuts (such as [DuckDuckGo's](http://duck.co/help/features/keyboard-shortcuts) or [Vimari's](https://github.com/guyht/vimari)), I find it annoying that searching from Safari's location bar leaves focus on the bar. I want focus to be on the web page after I hit <kbd>Enter</kbd>. This extension enables that on all of Safari's search engines, with an option to focus on either the web page or its search box.
